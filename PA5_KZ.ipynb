    "- Problem 1: Defined a dictionary 'spanishdict' with 20 English words and their spanish counterparts. Prompted the user for an English word to translate into Spanish. Using a 'while' loop with a nested 'if' function, the program will print the Spanish counterpart of the English word if it is part of the dictionary, print that it is not in the dictionary if it isn't, and stops the program if the entered value is 0. \n",
    "- Problem 2: Defined a dictionary 'classes' with 6 classes and their attributes and description. Then, defined the function print_player_data() to accept a player class, prints the description, and makes a table with the other attributes using PrettyTable. The user is prompted for a player class. using a 'while' loop with a nested 'if' fucntion, the program will print the output for the function print_player_data() if the player class is in the dictionary, print that it is not in the dictionary if it is not, and stops the program if the entered value is 0.
